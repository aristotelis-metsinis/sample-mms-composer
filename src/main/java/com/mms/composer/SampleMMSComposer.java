 * @(#)SampleMMSComposer.java	1.1
 *
 * Summary
 *
 * This sample application composes an MMS with a predefined structure and multimedia content consisting of two slides,
 * each slide containing text, image and audio and then simply writes the encoded MMS to a file. The MMS multimedia content
 * is stored in "src/main/resources/multimedia" folder, while output MMS file will be saved in "src/main/resources/mms" folder.
 *
 * Usage
 *
 * 	 	mms_creation$ java.exe -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -classpath "target/classes;lib/MMSLibrary.jar" com.mms.composer.SampleMMSComposer <address of the message sender> <address of the message receiver> <subject of the multimedia message>
 * example :
 * 	 	mms_creation$ java.exe -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -classpath "target/classes;lib/MMSLibrary.jar" com.mms.composer.SampleMMSComposer "made by Aristotelis" +306900000000/TYPE=PLMN "This is a nice message ..."
 *
 * Description
 *
 * This sample application was derived from the "OriginatingApp.java" file which came with the
 * Nokia MMS Java Library 1.1
 *
 * Instead of sending the MMS to an MMSC, however, this sample application simply writes the
 * encoded MMS to a file. That file can then be used, e.g. with various tools
 * that are provided by Nokia -- the "EAIF" emulator, the "Series60" terminal emulator
 * that comes with the "Series60" SDK for Symbian OS, the "7210" simulator, etc.
 * It should be worth mentioning that this file can also be placed on a standard web server, with the ".MMS" file
 * extension mapped to the MIME "content-type" : "application/vnd.wap.mms-message" as follows :
 *    <IfModule mime_module>
 * 	    	:
 * 		    :
 *       AddType application/vnd.wap.mms-message .mms .MMS
 *   </IfModule>
 * In this case, to send the MMS message, an "MMS Notification" message shall be sent to the recipient, referencing the
 * URL from which the MMS message shall be retrieved. That is, according to the "MMS Client Transactions" document, the
 * MMS client, upon receiving an "m-notification.ind" will issue an "HTTP GET" to the indicated URL. The MMS server will
 * send back a typical "HTTP 200 OK" (if everything is OK) and in the body of that, it will send an "m-retrieve-conf"
 * PDU in bytes (have a look also below at "Important Note"). The "Content-Type" HTTP header shall be "application/vnd.wap.mms-message".
 *
 * The sample application is made as simple as possible while still pointing out key points
 * which are *not* explained in the samples that accompany the library.
 * For instance, many of the headers that were set in the original sample were set
 * to default values. Those have been left out here for simplification.
 *
 * Basic gist of this sample application will be :
 * 1) Set headers.
 * 2) Add various content parts.
 * 3) Encode the message.
 * 4) Write the encoded message to a file.
 *
 * Important Note
 *
 * The Nokia MMS Java Library creates compiled MMS messages of the type "m-send-req". This format is the format that we
 * use to submit a message to an MMSC. Unfortunately, if we try to send an MMS notification message out to ask a mobile
 * phone to fetch one of these "m-send-req" messages, the mobile phone will reject the message with a "Network Error Occurred"
 * error. However, as the format of the "m-send-req" and "m-retrieve-conf" messages is very similar, we can often just
 * flip the second byte of the file to convert formats. Specifically, an "m-send-req" format file always starts with the
 * bytes "8C 80". An "m-retrieve-conf" format file always starts with the bytes "8C 84". So, changing that second byte
 * will often do the trick. This is actually how this sample application creates the output MMS file.
